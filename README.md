# Digital-Dice-Solutions
This repository consists of C-written solutions to the Digital Dice problems written by Paul J. Nahin.

### Notes:
* None of the codes ask for any user input. Instead, the parameter macros at the beginning of the code needs to be changed for different results.
* Problem 20 is going to be uploaded in the future commits.
* In problem 13 approximately 10% error occurs in the last part (SCENARIO = 3, SEPERATION = 2) of the problem. This will also be fixed later.
